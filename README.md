# Parallel and Distributed Computing - Lab 2  

This lab introduces **parallel programming** by implementing and timing functions using **threads and processes** in Python. It also analyzes performance through **speedup, efficiency, and scalability** using Amdahl’s and Gustafson’s Laws.


### Topics Covered
- Implementing parallel tasks using **threads** and **processes**.
- Measuring execution time for performance analysis.
- Comparing speedup and efficiency of different approaches.
