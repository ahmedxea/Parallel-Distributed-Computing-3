# Parallel and Distributed Computing - Lab 3 Part 1

This lab explores the Data Parallel Model by implementing summation using sequential, threading, and multiprocessing approaches in Python, measuring execution time and performance. It also analyzes speedup, efficiency, and scalability using Amdahl’s and Gustafson’s Laws to compare different parallelization techniques.

## Structure
- `notebooks/lab3_data_parallel.ipynb` → Contains all implementations, execution time analysis, and results.
- `requirements.txt` → List of required dependencies.
