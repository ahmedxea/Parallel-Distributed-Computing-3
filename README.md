### Brain Tumor Detection Using Parallel Processing

This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using machine learning and parallel processing to enhance efficiency. Multiprocessing is implemented to optimize image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, reducing execution time. The dataset consists of MRI images classified as "yes" (tumor detected) and "no" (no tumor). Images undergo preprocessing, and features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) properties for improved classification accuracy.
